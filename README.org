* Installation

The package is available from
[[https://melpa.org/#/too-wide-minibuffer-mode][MELPA]].  After installation, activate the
global minor mode with =M-x too-wide-minibuffer-mode RET=.

* Configuration


#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package too-wide-minibuffer-mode
  :init
  (too-wide-minibuffer-mode +1)

  :custom
  ;; The maximum allowed width for minibuffer window to display as is.
  (too-wide-minibuffer-max-width 200)
  ;; The mode is not compatible with `minibuffer-follows-selected-frame` set to `t`
  (minibuffer-follows-selected-frame nil))

This mode doesn't work properly if `minibuffer-follows-selected-frame` is set to
`t` and there are more than one frame. Please disable this setting in your
